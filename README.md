# linked-selects

Two select boxes linked together in such a way that when a user selects a value in the first select
the options in the second one change accordingly.

Implemented in react, vue.js and svelte web frameworks as an example for my medium.com article.

To see it in action, run `static-server` in the corresponding `public` directory.
Simply clicking the `index.html` won't work because of the way javascripts does the importing nowadays.

To build a project see the README.md files in the corresponding directories.
